How to Import SAS XPORT Files into R With The foreign package
Answer-
SAS date, time, and date/time variables are converted respectively to Date, POSIX, or chron objects

SAS labels are stored in "label" attributes on each variable, and are accessible using the label function.

SAS formats are stored in "SASformat" attributes on each variable, and are accessable using SASformat

SAS iformats are stored in "SASiformat" attributes on each variable, and are accessable using SASiformat

SAS integer variables are stored as integers unless force.integer is FALSE

If the file includes the output of PROC FORMAT CNTLOUT=, variables having customized label formats will be converted to factor objects with appropriate labels.

If a datasets in the original file has a label or type, these will be stored in the corresponding 'lable' and 'SAStype' attributes, which can be accessed by the label and SAStype functions.

If only a single dataset is present (after removing PROC FORMAT data when include.formats=FALSE), the return value is a single dataframe object. Otherwise the return is a list of dataframe objects.

Note that if include.formats=TRUE, the returned list will contain a dataframe named "FORMATS" containing any available 'PROC FORMAT' information.

2. How To Import SAS Files into R With The haven Package?
Answer-
read_sas() supports both sas7bdat files and the accompanying sas7bcat files that SAS uses to record value labels. write_sas() is currently experimental and only works for limited datasets.

Usage
1 read_sas(data_file, catalog_file = NULL, encoding = NULL
2 catalog_encoding = encoding, cols_only = NULL)
3 
4 write_sas(data, path)

Value
A tibble, data frame variant with nice defaults.

Variable labels are stored in the "label" attribute of each variable. It is not printed on the console, but the RStudio viewer will show it.

write_sas() returns the input data invisibly.
